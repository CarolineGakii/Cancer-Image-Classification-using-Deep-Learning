# Gastric-Cancer-Image-Classification-using-Deep-Learning
This project explores and compares the performance of three convolutional neural network architectures â€” ResNet50V2, DenseNet121, and CoAtNet â€” for classifying benign vs. malignant gastric histopathology images.  ðŸ“Œ Focus: Applying deep learning to locally acquired cancer images for accurate, explainable diagnosis and model evaluation.
